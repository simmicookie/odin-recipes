    <h1>Ramen</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Vegetarian ramen is a flavorful and satisfying twist on the traditional Japanese noodle soup, made entirely without meat or animal products. 
        Instead of a pork or chicken broth, this version uses a rich, umami-packed base from ingredients like miso, soy sauce, mushrooms, seaweed, and aromatic vegetables. 
        Topped with tender noodles, fresh greens, tofu, scallions, and a perfectly soft-boiled egg (or omitted for a vegan option), vegetarian ramen delivers depth and comfort in every bowl. 
        It is a nourishing, customizable dish that proves you do not need meat to enjoy a hearty and delicious ramen experience.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly slice, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black and/or white sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 tbsp gochugaru</li>
        <li>4 scallions</li>
        <li>1 2" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>8 dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 4x3" piece dried kombu</li>
        <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 baby bok choy, quartered lengthwise</li>
        <li>4 packages fresh ramen noodles</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Cilantro, nori sheets, jammy eggs (optional; for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook ¼ cup vegetable oil and 4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, in a medium pot over medium heat. 
            Stir often until garlic is beginning to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 Tbsp. black and/or white sesame seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden brown and crisp, about 1 minute. 
            (Don’t walk away; this happens fast, and the garlic can go from perfect to burned in seconds.) 
            Transfer mixture to a small bowl and stir in 1 Tbsp. gochugaru or 1½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes; season with kosher salt. 
            Set garlic oil aside for serving. Wipe out pot and reserve.</li>
        
        <li>Trim dark green parts from 4 scallions and thinly slice; set aside for serving. Coarsely chop white and pale green parts. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil in reserved pot over medium-high. Cook chopped scallions and one 2" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced, stirring often, until scallions are charred in spots, about 4 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp. tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to stick to the bottom of pot and darkens slightly, about 2 minutes. Add 8 dried shiitake mushrooms and one 4x3" piece dried kombu, then stir in 5 cups cold water. Bring to a boil; remove from heat and let sit until mushrooms soften, about 10 minutes. Remove and discard kombu.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer solids to a blender. Add 1 or 2 ladlefuls of broth to blender and purée until smooth. Stir purée back into broth in pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, one tablespoon at a time, whisking to combine after each addition before adding more. Stir in 1 Tbsp. low-sodium soy sauce; taste and season with kosher salt if desired. Reduce heat to low and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook 4 baby bok choy (about 12 oz. total), quartered lengthwise, in a large pot of boiling water until bright green and tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bok choy to a plate. Return water to a boil and cook four 5-oz. packages fresh ramen noodles according to package directions. Drain and divide among bowls.</li>
        <li>Ladle broth over noodles. Arrange bok choy and reserved dark green scallions on top, drizzle with reserved garlic oil and top with jammy eggs, toasted nori sheets, and/or cilantro if desired.</li>
    </ol>
